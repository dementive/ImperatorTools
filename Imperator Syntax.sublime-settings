	// How should textures be opened when clicked in hover popups? 2 options:
	// 1. default_program - open the texture in whatever the OS thinks it should be opened in
	// 2. in_sublime - open the texture directly in sublime,
	// the plugin will convert the dds texture to a png and display it in a sublime tab
	// converted files will be cached so when opened a second time it is faster, the cache can be cleared with a command in the command pallete.
